### The 2nd Game -

_(March 2016)_

#### A drop of me

When my teacher (and friend after all these years) Achilles Nasios, asked me at the 
first lesson "why photography?" the answer was:
"because every time  I'm playing with a camera I have a strange feeling in my 
stomach and I would like to know what it's all about".\
I had this feeling with my first camera, which i bought from a flea market when I was 
sixteen and I still have it until today.\
My real need grew during a personal "crisis" back in 2005 that push me to make big 
changes in my life.
So here I am still studying, following that feeling, to an amazing experiential journey 
in self-awareness through the Game
