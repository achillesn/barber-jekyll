The 9th Game - I have become a wonderer and a moment capturer, of an inner photographic exploration of the land and its people. I capture light and its relation to shapes and forms. I search for the infinitely small moment where we can taste beauty and incorporate it once and for all in our private eternity. I search for words that will help me manifest the poetic logos of photography. Photography for me becomes an eternal pursue of the Human Being, a journey to the centers of my soul, a path to transcendence of this virtual world toward the world of poetry, so that one day I could speak of the unspoken. Light capturing is one of the reasons I exist. I was born in Christmas of 1963 and since then Photo graphy ZÎ©.
