### The 7th Game -

_(June 2018)_

I am a Greece-based self-taught photographer. My interest in photography sparked in 2014, when I started experimenting with analog photography. My work has been published in a number of publications such as Agitate (Australia, October 2015), Photoklassik (Germany, September 2016), Adore Noir Magazine (Canada, October 2017), Click Magazine (Italy, December 2017), Photographize (USA, February 2018).
