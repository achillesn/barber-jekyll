I was born in Pafos \[Cyprus] on August 1981. I am a father of a girl and a boy that are my source of inspiration both in life and in photography. I have participated in the international project ‘HOME’ with tutors Achilles Nasios and Jason Eskenazi. Photography for me is a way to escape my reality. Still searching my voice.

### The Park

‘To see a World in a Grain of Sand
And a Heaven in a Wild Flower,
Hold Infinity in the palm of your hand
And Eternity in an hour…’ \[Auguries of Innocence William Blake]

This set of photos is part of an ongoing project which at first began as a photography exercise but in the way was evolved as a family diary for the days of innocence.
