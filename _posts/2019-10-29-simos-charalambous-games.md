# The Paphos PhotoGame

_(June 2019)_

## Morning at the Window

…The brown waves of fog toss up to me 

Twisted faces…,

And tear from a passer-by with muddy skirts 

An aimless smile that hovers in the air 

And vanishes along the level of the roofs.

\[from the poem ‘Morning at the Window’, Thomas Stern Elliot]
