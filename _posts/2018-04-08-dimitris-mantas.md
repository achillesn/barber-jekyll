Born in March of 1976, a husband and father of two girls, I had been no more than an occasional consumer of art for most of my life.

In 2012, I discovered that photography is more than holiday snapshots and at that moment I swear I felt something move inside me. I consider myself a learner of the craft since then.

Sometimes I feel that a photographer is trapped inside my Engineer body, but for the moment I am afraid to let him out.

### Minus One

_(May 2018)_

He is there. Does this mean he’s not absent?
You expect him to be present. Everyone sees him, but it’s as if he wants to be invisible.
Your words left unanswered, leaving you to wonder if he even heard you, although he seems to be right next to you.
You’re struggling to find signs of his presence – something he did, somewhere he left his mark on – but you end up with nothing.
You’re left with something that looks like empty bodies, as he doesn’t even come close to them to feel the life they have inside.
He never made you feel so alone.
Present, but absent. Minus One.

### Dreams

_(Jan. 2018)_

Dreams are connected to the circle of life. In the beginning, dreams are about the fairytales - within them we become the heroes of the story, somewhere in the sphere of imagination.

Growing up, dreams are what we wish to become. "I want to be a ballerina when I grow up" - "I want to be a vet, a teacher". We will probably become something else at the end but if a child cannot dream, then who can?

Next, when reality has caught up with us, we don't dream of the future any more, but of what we have lost at present – a moment of needed solitude, a moment of peace, losing some of the burden of the daily routine.

And, inevitably, the moment will come when we will dream of the past - something we lost, something that is missing and we are not whole any more.

Until the time comes when we become a thought too and, if we are lucky, we become the dream for someone else who is left behind.
