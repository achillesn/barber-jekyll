Born in March of 1976, a husband and father of two girls, I had been no more than an occasional consumer of art for most of my life.

In 2012, I discovered that photography is more than holiday snapshots and at that moment I swear I felt something move inside me. I consider myself a learner of the craft since then.

Sometimes I feel that a photographer is trapped inside my Engineer body, but for the moment I am afraid to let him out.

### Dreams

Dreams are connected to the circle of life. In the beginning, dreams are about the fairytales - within them we become the heroes of the story, somewhere in the sphere of imagination.

Growing up, dreams are what we wish to become. "I want to be a ballerina when I grow up" - "I want to be a vet, a teacher". We will probably become something else at the end but if a child cannot dream, then who can?

Next, when reality has caught up with us, we don't dream of the future any more, but of what we have lost at present â€“ a moment of needed solitude, a moment of peace, losing some of the burden of the daily routine.

And, inevitably, the moment will come when we will dream of the past - something we lost, something that is missing and we are not whole any more.

Until the time comes when we become a thought too and, if we are lucky, we become the dream for someone else who is left behind.
