### The waiting room.

The lake remains  motionless.  The signal was given and the feast began. Following the day, there will be colors  , until they reach the Land of  the Hesperides. Colors ask us to reshape the clay. The dream of  abolishing  our daily boredom .

### A daily route

As he wakes up he opens the eyes and looks around.  He is once more in the usual place, at the window. The bus continues speeding. Outside ,  the city is shredded  into unrelated pieces . Faces are revealed and suddenly occupy the space. The Passersby. Unknown faces even though so familiar. Eye pupils are  dilated . Sensations trigger the mental euphoria. He continues to press the shutter button. Images crash like the waves of a large visual storm  onto his eyes . Images that gradually find   their place at a visual sequence. Very often the bus stops. At the   stops the   Passersby   pass the torch to the others who appear from nowhere. At the beginning of the twenty first century. A common bus route, a daily routine.
