I was born and raised in Athens, Greece. I have studied psychology. I have taken photography lessons with Thanos Papadopoulos and Achilleas Nasios. I have overcome realities and dreams, I donâ€™t care what it is. Me and the camera in an ongoing relationship, the medium to help me understand what I see.
