Born in Serres,
became interested in photography during printing courses – never cease being in love with the process.
Love traveling – always feeling freedom and joy with a camera in my hands, in a foreign place.
For me, is always important to find a subject/point that excites me and try to bring this inspiration to my pictures.

Live in Athens, Greece
