I was born in 1960 in Athens, Greece, where I live until today. I was employed in the tourism industry. I first became involved with photography in 2011 and I am member of the Photography Circle since 2013. I have participated in group photography exhibitions.

### Free Fall

It is the feeling of falling.
I am setting out on a journey, freed of constrictions.
The gates to a new dimension are gaping open, pulling me.
I am only touching its end to set out again.
