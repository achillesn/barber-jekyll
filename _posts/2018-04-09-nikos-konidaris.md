Born 1976 in Athens, Greece. I have attended two seminars on Street and Art photography by Lukas Vasilikos and lessons on Visual Storytelling by Achilles Nasios. I have participated in the group exhibition “Lost & Found” curated by Void Photo and “The Last Game”, a group exhibition curated by Achilles Nasios. Finally I got selected to exhibit my work as part of Eastreet 4 group exhibition in Lublin, Poland.
