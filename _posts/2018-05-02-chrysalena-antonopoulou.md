I was born in Athens, Greece in 1983. I live and work in Athens.

I studied Economics and hold a MSc in Finance. I started studying photography in 2013 at pragma and have attended a series of workshops and courses on photography and art theory, organized by the Athens School of Fine Arts, the Depression Era collective and others.

Since 2010, I work as a photoarchivist (chief of the Photographic Archive Service of a Historical Archive).

I have participated with my work in several group exhibitions in Athens.
