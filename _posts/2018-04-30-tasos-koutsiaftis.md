I was born and raised in Athens. I studied Mechanical Engineer in Patra City, Greece and took my first steps in photography in 2013 when I bought my first Dslr camera. I have attended many seminars about photography and have exposed my work in several group exhibitions in Greece and abroad. In 2017 I won the first prize on the "Athens photo Marathon" in one category. The past few years I take photos of the Balkan region for the project “common routes”.

I experience photography as a way out of the routine and everyday life and I am constantly discovering new parts of myself I have never imagined existed!

Photography is not just seeing, it's more of a feeling. If you can't feel, then you will never get others to feel anything when looking at your pictures.
