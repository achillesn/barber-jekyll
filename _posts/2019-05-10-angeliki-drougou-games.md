I was born in Athens in 1977. As a pathologist, I look through the lens of my microscope into an inner world made up of human cells. Altering my visual potential through lenses fascinates me as much as discovering new worlds.  I use my camera as a vehicle that carries me away from everyday reality to my fantasy playground, where no rules apply.
