I was born and raised in the region of Arcadia, central Peloponnese, Greece. My relationship with photography started at a very young age; a strange attraction towards the medium itself was its starting point. At the age of 30 I came to the realization that photography can go beyond the obvious, so I started to explore its sea of possibilities. What I came to realize was that through photography I can express things which I cannot otherwise express in words.
