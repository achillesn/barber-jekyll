It was the technological progress of cameras and their ever increasing capabilities of accurately capturing an image that initially drew me to photography.
Though, as I delved more into it, my attention started steering towards all the elements of the image that technology alone was not enough  to unveil. 

Soon I found myself exploring the means of photographic expression and through this exploration I became more sensitive to perceiving the visual information around me.  The photographic process has provided me with a tool to better comprehend oneself and be more receiving of other peopleâ€™s expression.
