The 8th Game (Oceanis)-(February 2019).

Having lived adrift for long between dream and reality I was found by Photography and it became the means of setting the chaos that existed inside me in some kind of order. Step by step, taking photographs, not only have I learned to reach the unexplored aspects of myself, but also to discover, at the same time, new ways of interpreting the world and the enigmas hidden within it. Eventually, I have realized that the images that I create, have always lived inside me, subconsciously, and they seem to be there only to tell my story.
