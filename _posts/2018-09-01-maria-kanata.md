I grew up in Amfissa in the Delphi area, in an atmosphere full of art with a father who was a painter, so it was almost inevitable to follow in his footsteps. 

I studied sculpture and ceramics in Italy and worked for several years teaching art  at school. Photography has entered my life in recent years and I am passionate about it. Through it I try to capture my thoughts and get inspired  from my subject and the socio-political environment. 

I attended photography seminars with Plato Rivellis, Costi Antoniadis, Eleni Mouzakitis and Lampros Papanikolatos. I have made 2 personal exhibitions of sculpture and have taken part in collaborative art and photo exhibitions.
