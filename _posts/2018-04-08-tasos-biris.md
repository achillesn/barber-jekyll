I have become a wonderer and a moment capturer, of an inner photographic exploration of the land and its people.  I capture light and its relation to shapes and forms. I search for the infinitely small moment where we can taste beauty and incorporate it once and for all in our private eternity.  I search for words that will help me manifest the poetic logos of photography. Photography for me becomes an eternal pursue of the Human Being, a journey to the centers of my soul, a path to transcendence of this virtual world toward the world of poetry, so that one day I could speak of the unspoken.  Light capturing is one of the reasons I exist. I was born in Christmas of 1963 and since then Photo graphy ZΩ.

### Xmass dream

When I was just a little boy, every Christmas Eve, before I slept, I would close my eyes and travel high above the earth, searching for the tiny lights, as if I was searching to find the place, Christ was born in, almost like the three Magi had followed the Star of Bethlehem, until I would fall asleep dreaming a Christmas Dream and lose my self in light. Born in Christmas.

## No one has ever seen Bahamut

No one has ever seen Bahamut
Some think it's a dog
Some think it's a newt
All we know is that the lonely Bahamut
Floats endlessly through all time and all space
With all of us and everything
Floating in a single tear
Of his eye
_(Rephrased from the lyrics of the song Bahamut, Hazmat Modine)_
