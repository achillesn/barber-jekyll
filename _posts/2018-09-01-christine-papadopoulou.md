### The 7th Game -

_(June 2018)_

I was born and raised in Brussels. Today I live and call Athens my home. I have been involved with photography since 2016 and followed the artistic photography seminar of Lucas Vasilakos in November of 2017. I have been a part of 2 collaborative exhibitions : 

_" Small pieces in time " and " την μελαγχολική μου τέχνη ασκώντας " _

_ _I am currently working on my own solo project “Anthi” (“Flowers/Blossoms”). To me photography is freedom !
