My dream, from the early stages of my life, was to create pictures.
Starting with analog photography and later experimenting with digital possibilities, in agony to re-define my self, I lost the dream.
It feels like that through the photogames I started to be reconnected to this dream again. I started to searche deeper and thatÂ´s fun. Not always easy, but fun.
