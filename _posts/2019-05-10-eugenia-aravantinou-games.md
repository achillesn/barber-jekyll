Photography constitutes for me the means to look deeper into myself, my experiences, the light and the darkness I carry within. On some occasions it is a journey, on others it is a getaway. It is discovery, freedom, joy. The place where I can dream, or visit a nightmareâ€¦ It is the road to freedom and happiness. It is me looking at myself straight in the eye, fearlessly. It is the breath of air I share with you.
