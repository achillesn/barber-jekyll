## **INTERGAMES**

- - -
Before the beginning of the New Year we would like to wish you happy and creative holidays, and to share with you a small sample of our research and the shape it is taking via the inter-games.
These games are designed to be played on-line, and during them multifaceted ways of learning and knowledge are gradually growing.

We hope that you will enjoy our images, as we did enjoy the process which revealed them to us.
Since our games are not over yet and we are looking forward to continuing, we will eventually get back to share with you the complete works.
Until thenâ€¦ keep on playing.
